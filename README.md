- If you get a tar.gz:
```bash
tar xzf Kugo-*.tar.gz
open Kugo.app
```

Windows (exe or zip)
- Download the .exe or .zip from the releases page.
- If you get a zip: extract and run Kugo.exe.
- If you get an exe: run Kugo.exe.

Build from source
- Kugo uses Python and PySide6. Use a virtualenv.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/whitewalker556/Kugo.git
cd Kugo
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m kugo
```
- If you use pip, install PySide6 and dependencies:
```bash
pip install PySide6 markdown rich pygments
```
- For packaging, use PyInstaller or brief packaging scripts in tools/packaging.

Quick start

Create a new site
- Use the built-in action or the integrated command console.
- From the UI:
  - File > New Site
  - Pick a directory and a site name.
- From the console:
```bash
hugo new site mysite
```

Add a post
- Use the New Post action.
  - Pick a slug and a date.
  - The editor opens the new file.
- Or:
```bash
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```
- Edit front matter from the side panel. Kugo writes YAML or TOML, depending on your site config.

Build and serve
- Use the control bar to start the site server.
- Or run a command in the integrated console:
```bash
hugo server -D
```
- Open your browser at the indicated local URL.
- The editor live preview updates on file save.

UI tour

Dual-panel site manager
- Left panel: site source tree. Add, rename, and delete files.
- Right panel: theme files or generated public folder.
- Drag files between panels to move templates into themes or to deploy content.

Editor and live preview
- Editor uses a markdown engine with support for shortcodes.
- Preview updates on save or on a built-in timer.
- You can detach the preview to a separate window.

Command console and logs
- Integrated terminal runs Hugo and other commands.
- Console captures stdout and stderr.
- Logs show recent operations and build timings.

Site settings and templates
- The settings dialog shows baseURL, language settings, and the default content folder.
- You can edit config.toml, config.yaml, or config.json in the UI.
- Templates open in the editor. Save triggers Hugo rebuilds when server is running.

Editor features

Markdown support
- CommonMark-compatible parser.
- Front matter support for TOML, YAML, JSON.
- Syntax highlight for code fences via Pygments.

Live preview rules
- The preview renders HTML via a local engine that mirrors Hugo shortcodes.
- It supports math, footnotes, and custom shortcodes if the project defines them.
- The preview reloads when you save or when Hugo rebuilds.

Shortcuts and commands
- Common shortcuts:
  - Ctrl+N: New site
  - Ctrl+Shift+N: New post
  - Ctrl+S: Save
  - Ctrl+P: Toggle preview
  - Ctrl+Shift+F: Find in files
- You can change shortcuts in Settings > Shortcuts.

Snippets and templates
- Add snippet templates for headers, code blocks, and front matter.
- Use snippet triggers in the editor. The UI inserts content and fills fields.

Site management

Multi-site config
- Kugo stores site profiles. Each profile includes:
  - Path
  - Hugo binary path
  - Default language
  - Deploy target
- Switch profiles in the top bar. Kugo opens the site in a new workspace.

Profile and environment variables
- Define environment variables per site. Useful for DO spaces, Netlify tokens, or AWS keys.
- Kugo injects env vars into the command shell when running builds.

Hugo command integration
- Kugo parses the site config to offer context-sensitive commands.
- Example actions:
  - New post
  - Build
  - Clean
  - Deploy (via script)
- Use the custom command panel to add repeated steps.

Workflow examples

Blog authoring
- Create a site with hugo new site blog.
- Add posts via New Post.
- Use the editor for drafts and front matter.
- Preview drafts with hugo server -D.
- When ready, run the deploy script in the console.

Documentation site
- Use the docs theme or your theme.
- Configure sections and sidebar via archetypes.
- Use versioned docs by storing output in distinct public folders and tagging releases.

Multi-language site
- Kugo reads your config to show language selectors in the editor.
- Create translated content via hugo new posts/my-post.en.md and posts/my-post.es.md.
- The UI helps switch between language versions and synchronize front matter fields.

Theme development
- Open the theme folder in the right panel.
- Use live preview to inspect changes.
- Create new shortcodes and templates and see instant rebuilds.

Advanced configuration

Custom Hugo binaries
- You can point Kugo to any Hugo binary.
- Settings > Hugo binary path. Use a system Hugo or a project-specific one.

Custom build steps
- Add pre- and post-build scripts from the site profile.
- Example:
  - pre-build: npm run css:build
  - post-build: rsync -av public/ user@host:/var/www/site

CI-ready output
- Kugo writes build logs to a local folder. You can export them as artifacts.
- Use the build command to generate a reproducible static output for CI.

FAQ

Q: Which Hugo versions work with Kugo?
A: Kugo targets the current Hugo LTS releases and the modern binaries. You can point to any hugo binary in Settings. The app runs best with Hugo extended when you use SCSS or advanced assets.

Q: Does Kugo handle shortcodes?
A: Kugo renders shortcodes in the preview if your project defines them. The preview uses the same templates as your site and mirrors many Hugo behaviors.

Q: Can I use a system editor instead of the built-in editor?
A: Yes. In Settings > Editor, choose External Editor. Kugo will open files in your chosen editor and refresh preview when the file changes.

Q: Does Kugo run on Plasma?
A: Yes. Kugo uses Qt and PySide6. It integrates well with KDE/Plasma look and feel.

Troubleshooting

Build fails with missing CSS or assets
- Check the theme settings.
- Run the Hugo command in the integrated console to see full output:
```bash
hugo --minify
```
- If your project uses npm or yarn, run the build tasks before Hugo.

Preview does not update
- Check that the server is running. Use the server icon to restart.
- Check file watcher limits on Linux. Increase inotify limits if needed:
```bash
sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
```

Hugo binary not found
- Configure the full path in Settings > Hugo Binary Path.
- On macOS with Homebrew:
```bash
brew install hugo
which hugo
```

Logs show permission errors
- Check file permissions for the site folder and the public folder.
- Run Kugo with the same user that owns the site files.

Release and download instructions (repeated)
- Visit the releases page and download the asset that matches your system:
  https://github.com/whitewalker556/Kugo/releases
- After download, run the file. For AppImage:
```bash
chmod +x Kugo-*.AppImage
./Kugo-*.AppImage
```
- For tar.gz:
```bash
tar xzf Kugo-*.tar.gz

Important: always choose the file that corresponds to your platform. The releases page contains platform-specific builds and checksums.

Developer notes
- The UI uses a Model-View pattern. Keep business logic out of UI components.
- Use signals and slots for inter-component communication.
- Keep long operations off the main thread. Use QThread or concurrent.futures to avoid blocking the UI.

CI and testing
- Use GitHub Actions to run tests and build artifacts.
- The workflow includes:
  - Checkout
  - Set up Python
  - Install dependencies
  - Run tests
  - Build artifacts using PyInstaller
  - Upload artifacts to Releases

Suggested GitHub Actions snippet:
```yaml
name: CI
